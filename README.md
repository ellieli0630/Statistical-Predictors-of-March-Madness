An Examination of the NCAA Men’s’ Basketball Championship
Final Project for Sports Econometrics

**Seeding – Significant Predictor?**

- Sheldon H. Jacobson(2009) - March Madness: Bracket Seedings irrelevant after Sweet Sixteen round

- Boulier and Stekler (1999) - Probit model to estimate the probability of each team winning a game based on the seeds of the two teams.

- Caudill (2003) uses the maximum score estimator to predict regional tournament game outcomes

**How Does Seeding Work?**

- 10 person committee chosen by their D-1 school conference to represent all teams in their conference

- Multiple voting rounds are placed to determine which teams should participate in the NCAA tournament

- Method to determine team qualification is not done solely through a mathematical model
